<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Jahnavi Krishna. I am a technical student who is interested in programming, machine learning, and IoT-based projects. 
I like working on practical projects using MATLAB, C, and Python, especially related to data analysis and sensor-based systems.
I prefer step-by-step learning and understanding concepts clearly rather than just memorizing theory.
I am curious, hardworking, and focused on improving my skills for future internships and career opportunities.</p>
